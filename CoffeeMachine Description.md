This Project is a Software version of a Coffee Machine.
Wherein the Machine starts with a certain amount of resources i.e. Water, Milk and Coffee. 
Whenever an order is placed, the resources are checked first and if we have sufficient resources the order is processed further.
The Money Machine looks after the transaction made by the user and makes the coffee onces it is succesfull.
The Menu starts with a certain amount of items, but they can be increased as required.
By using MenuItem Class we can add items to the menu. If user enters "off" the machine stops and the Resources left are displayed.
Atlast we can check the profit from the machine.
